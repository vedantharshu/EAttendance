# EAttendance
This is a Attendance Monitoring App
The motive behind developing this app was to enable the teachers working from home to maintain the attendance record of the student attending the e lecture.
The app's working is divided into three parts:
1. the admin: to add teachers, students and assign classes for the teachers also he can add or remove students.
2. the teacher: he/she has capability to mark the attendance and update the attendance for current or previous days.
3. the student: any student can see his overall attendance and also check his attendance for any given day.

Started on 5th july and completed on 25th july 2020, with the help of my dear friends Shivansh Srivastava, Ojasva Verma and Jagrat Katara.
